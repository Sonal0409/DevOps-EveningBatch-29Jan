Service is an Object is kubernetes that allows communication to the pods from outside the clsuter.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata: 
 name: mysvc1
spec:
selector:
  type: webserver
 type: ClusterIP  
 ports:
 - targetPort: 80  # container port
   port: 80   # service port



ClusterIp : It is a service that allows pods to communicate within the cluster 
Ip address internal to the cluster
you cannot access this IP outside the cluster.



> Outside the cluster:
we cannot reach to the pod application via its ipadress:portnumber
we cannot reach to the pod application via the cluster IP and port number

How to access pods from outside the cluster?

We will use NodePort Service type
NodePort : It is a type of service in which users can communicate to the pod outside the clsuter

A nodeport service:

 > creates a cluster Ip
 > allocates a portnumber of every node of cluster 
 > Node port range in K8s is 30000 to 32767

 > using this node port and external IP of any worker node, users can access the pod from outside cluster

Service  :

 > for communication with the pods outside or inside the cluster 

 > 2 pods to communicate within the cluster -> cluster IP

 > Service find its endpoints --> using the labels

 > service endpoints = PODs with matching labels 

 > Service will map port to target container port 

 > For communication otuside the cluster use Nodeport/ LoadBalancer
 
We will have aport open on every node 

user : VM ipaddress:Nodeport 

if load LoadBalancer
just use external Ip to send request to service --> pod
