Declarative pipeline: 

- Pipeline is nothing but a set of tasks executed one after the other
- In jenkins we create pipeline using the pipeline template while creating the job
- A pipeline in jenkisn is created by writing code -> pipeline as Code
- The pipeline code is based on groovy scripting -> And the syntax is called as Declarative pipeline syntax
- A Declarative pipeline syntax is easy to read and write.
- No special programming skills are required to write Declarative pipeline syntax
- This Declarative pipeline syntax is very structured, the jenkins admin has to follow the structure and write pipeline code
- Jenkisn pipeline template provides an editor where we can write the pipeline code
- In real time, many admins prefer writing pipeline code using VS code editor and push pipeline code to github
- Once the pieplien code is written jenkisn itself will validate the code and then it will execute the code
- Jenkisn gives us a small tool called as pipeline code snippet generator tool -> this tool can automatically generate pipeline code for you based on your inputs
- a pipeline starts with keyword pipeline

Declarative Syntax:

  key 'value'

  company 'Edureka'
  trainer 'Sonal'
  number 1234566

Key is given by jenkins, value will be given by user


// no pipeline code otuside

pipeline{

tools{
 		// here we will write names of tool(given on tools page) that we have to use to exeucte the pipeline tasks
                // this section is optional

}

// which Virtual machine/agent do you want to run your pipeline

agent any    ==> here the term 'any' means , the current jenkisn server



// there will be only one agent section
// this is a mandatory section

parameters{
                              // names of variables and values
}
