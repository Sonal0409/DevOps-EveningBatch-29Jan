Detached Mode:(-d)
=======================

Whenver we run docker command with detached mode:

 > A container will be created
 > Container will be up & running
 > user will not be attached to the terminal of to the container

# docker run --name n1 -d nginx

===============================
Attach to the terminal of the container from the host machine:
============================

# docker exec -it <containername> command

# docker exec -it web /bin/bash



Access app running on the Containers from browser of the machine


Port Forwarding OR Port Mapping:
===================================

By default an application on docker container is avaibale on its exposed port.

It is the users internet that cannot reach the container port

For this we have do port forwarding or mapping in docker

i.e. we have to map a VM free system port with container port

example = 8989:80

systemport:containerport

> If a container is already created, we canot do port forwarding for the container

> port forwarding will be applied at the docker run comamnd itself

> flag for port forwarding (-p)

# docker run --name web1 -d -p 8989:80 nginx


> if you want docker to do port mapping then use flag -P

# docker run --name web2 -d -P httpd

=============================================

Docker Volumes:

It is a concept in which we preserve the data of container in the volumes created on docker host

Whenver a containe ris deleted, the data in the container is also lost. In order to overcome this problem, we have docker volumes

Volumes needs to be mounted on the container directory. whatever is there in the container directory will be preserved on the volume directory

Voluems ar eof 2 types:

- named volume
 in this volume a specific name is given to volume directory and volume is created in docker area (/var/lib/docker)

- bind mount
  in this volume the data of the container can be preserved in any directory of the host machine
there is no name given to the volume

Note that: you can use volume to place/copy files on the container directory also.

Volume mapping has to be done, during container runtime.

Named volumes

1. Create a docker volume that will preserve the data of a container

> Create a named volume

# docker volume ls
# docker volume create myvol

> where is the volume created

# docker volume inspect myvol

/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data

> mount the volume on the container directory

 docker run -it --name cont1 -v myvol:/tmp ubuntu

> preserve data from contaienr to volume

create some files in container and come out of container

> delete container.. data will be there in volume directory

# docker rm -f cont1

# cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data

=============================================

2. Place files from volume on to a container

> go to volume directory, it will have some files

> create a container and mount the volume

docker run -it --name cont1 -v myvol:/tmp ubuntu

> you will observe volume data is there on contaienr sdirectory


try out latter


create a volume and mount on a container1
store some files on the volume
create container2 mapping same volume
make chnages int eh container directory, you wills ee chnages available on second cont also.

==============================================

Bind Mounts:
===================

In this case, data will be saved on any directory of host machine

I have got source code for webapplication in github

https://github.com/Sonal0409/ecomm.git

we will clone the code in docker host in a directory

we will mount the directory on a container with image httpd

We will access the application on the container form browser of our machine
